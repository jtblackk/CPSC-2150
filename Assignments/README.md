The assignments document the process of engineering an extendable, more-than-two-player, digital version of tic-tac-toe. It covers requirements analysis, planning with UML, and the iterative process of developing the end product. 

The projects are all in Java and used the Model View Controller design pattern.

HW1 = Requirements analysis, UML diagrams for 8x8/5-win Tic-Tac-Toe. Skeleton for project was also made in java

HW2 = Neater documentation, classes fully implemented for 8x8/5-win Tic-Tac-Toe

HW3 = Implemented new requirements: extendable board size and variable win threshold

HW4 = Implemented new requirement: allow more than two players

HW5 = Writing and implementation of a test suite using JUnit

HW6 = Plug in back-end to a GUI
